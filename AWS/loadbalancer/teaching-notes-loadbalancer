Loadbalancer Types
  - Classic loadbalancer
    - Classic Load Balancer provides basic load balancing across multiple Amazon EC2 instances
  
  - Application loadbalancer
    - Application Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides advanced 
      request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and containers.
    - Operating at the individual request level (Layer 7), Application Load Balancer 
      routes traffic to targets within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) based on the content of the request.
  
  - Network loadbalancer
    - Network Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) traffic where extreme performance is required. Operating at the connection level (Layer 4), 
      Network Load Balancer routes traffic to targets within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and is capable of 
      handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies.
    - Network Load Balancer is also optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns.

- Internet facing loadbalancer
  - Nodes of internet facing loadbalancer have public ips
  - The DNS name of an Internet-facing load balancer is publicly resolvable to the public IP addresses of the nodes
  - Internet-facing load balancers can route requests from clients over the Internet
  - Internet facing loadbalancer should be in public subnet
  
- Internal loadbalancer
  - When an internal load balancer is created, it receives a public DNS name
  - The DNS servers resolve the DNS name of your load balancer to the private IP addresses of the load balancer nodes for your internal load balancer.
  - Each load balancer node is connected to the private IP addresses of the back-end instances using elastic network interfaces
  - Cross zone loadbalancing need to be enabled to access other avaialability instance. Otherwise in the same AZ it will loadbalance.
  

 Discuss Scenario:-
 
  Application having multiple tiers. Webserver is connected to the internet and database server is only connected to the webserver.
  You can design this architecture using both Internal loadbalancer and Internet facing loadbalancer.
    - Create an internet facing loadbalancer and register webserver with it
    - Create an internal loadbalancer and register database server with it
    - Webserver received traffic from the internet facing loadbalancer and send it to the internal loadbalancer
    - Database server receives request from the internal loadbalancer
    
Demo:-

1) Create Internet facing loadbalancer (Classic loadbalancer & Application loadbalancer)

  - Make sure loadbalancer is created in public subnet
  - Do a dig and make sure you are getting a public ip for DNS name
  - In instance security group allow all traffic for the "loadbalancer security group"
  - Also make sure index.html file is there in apache folder
  - For healthcheck to succeede you would need to create a dummy index.html in the /var/www/ path. Or just try giving /html/index.html in the healthcheck

2) Show how loadbalancer load balance the traffic
  - Create two ec2 instances in public subnet. Enable public ip also, though its not required.
  - Install apache2 in it. And update index.html to distinguish two apps(Like include strings like first and second app)
  - Create a classis/app loadbalancer and add these two instances.
  - You should see two diferent app coming up!
