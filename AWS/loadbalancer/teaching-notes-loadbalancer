Loadbalancer Types
  - Classic loadbalancer
  - Application loadbalancer
  - Network loadbalancer

- Internet facing loadbalancer
  - Nodes of internet facing loadbalancer have public ips
  - The DNS name of an Internet-facing load balancer is publicly resolvable to the public IP addresses of the nodes
  - Internet-facing load balancers can route requests from clients over the Internet
  
- Internal loadbalancer

 Discuss Scenario:-
 
  Application having multiple tiers. Webserver is connected to the internet and database server is only connected to the webserver.
  You can design this architecture using both Internal loadbalancer and Internet facing loadbalancer.
    - Create an internet facing loadbalancer and register webserver with it
    - Create an internal loadbalancer and register database server with it
    - Webserver received traffic from the internet facing loadbalancer and send it to the internal loadbalancer
    - Database server receives request from the internal loadbalancer
    
 - Cross zone loadbalancing need to be enabled to access other avaialability instance. Otherwise in the same AZ it will loadbalance.
