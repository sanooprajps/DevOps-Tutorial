1) Create VPC/Subnets/Routes and add an instance in that VPC
2) Make the instance reachable from internet (Internet Gateway)
3) Private and Public subnets
4) NAT gateway
5) Difference between Security Group and NACL
    - Security group is firewall for EC2 instances
      - Only Allow. Otherwise all debnied. You cannot deny certain rules in Security Group
      - Security group is only to instances.
      - Security groups are statefule :- This means any changes applied to an incoming rule will be automatically applied to the outgoing rule. 
        e.g. If you allow an incoming port 80, the outgoing port 80 will be automatically opened.
    - NACL is firewall for Subnets
      - Both allow and deny are supproted
      - Any instance in the subnets follow NACL rules
      - Network ACLs are stateless :- This means any changes applied to an incoming rule will not be applied to the outgoing rule. 
        e.g. If you allow an incoming port 80, you would also need to apply the rule for outgoing traffic.
    - Subnets can have only one ACL where as instance can have multiple security groups
