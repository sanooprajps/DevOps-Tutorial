Route 53
 - Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System service
Hosted Zones
 - A hosted zone is analogous to a traditional DNS zone file; it represents a collection of records that can be 
   managed together, belonging to a single parent domain name
 - Public hosted zones
  - A public hosted zone determines how traffic is routed on the Internet.
 - Private hosted zones
  - A private hosted zone determines how traffic is routed within an Amazon VPC. Your resources are not accessible outside the VPC. 
    You can use any domain name.

Routing Policy

Simple routing policy – Use for a single resource that performs a given function for your domain, for example, a web server that serves content for the example.com website.

Failover routing policy – Use when you want to configure active-passive failover.

Geolocation routing policy – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users.

Geoproximity routing policy – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and, optionally, shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in another.

Latency routing policy – Use when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic to the region that provides the best latency.

Multivalue answer routing policy – Use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random.

Weighted routing policy – Use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify.
