An Auto Scaling group contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes 
of automatic scaling and management. Both maintaining the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group and automatic scaling 
are the core functionality of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service.

- Difference between lauch configuration and launch tempalte

Launch tempalte is same like Lauch configuration. Provided, launch template allows you to have multiple version of the template.
AWS recommends to use launch template instead of launch configuration.
Also, you are allowed to add multiple instance types instead of one single type so for example you have specific workload 
you can run fixed number of instances as on-demand or spot instances.

- Talk about scaling policies

A scaling policy is a set of instructions for making such adjustments in response to an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that 
you assign to it. In each policy, you can choose to add or remove a specific number of instances or a percentage of 
the existing group size, or you can set the group to an exact size.  When the alarm triggers, it will execute the policy 
and adjust the size of your group accordingly.

Demo:-

1) Create launch configuration or launch template initially
  - Create auto scaling group using the launch config/template
  
Note: Here goto tags and show the importance of tags. Show ASG tags/Launch template tags.

2) How to add Application loadbalancer to Auto Scaling Groups?
  - Create application loadbalancer
  - In the target group section dont' add any instances. If you are adding instance other than ASG then add instance here (listeners)
  - Now, goto ASG.
  - Create launch template
  - Edit ASG and update target group as the same name created during ALB creation.
